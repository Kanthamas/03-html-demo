        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are
          the fundamental building blocks of the web. HTML provides the
          structure and content of web pages, while CSS controls the
          presentation and styling. Together, they enable the creation of
          visually appealing and interactive websites. In this article, we will
          explore the history, features, trends, and answer some commonly asked
          questions about HTML and CSS.

      <section id="history">
        <h2>History of HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          HTML was first introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 as a means to
          share scientific documents among researchers. It was a simple markup
          language that allowed users to define the structure of a document
          using tags. Over time, HTML evolved with new versions being released,
          such as HTML2, HTML3, HTML4, and the current HTML5, which was
          standardized in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS emerged in the late 1990s as a way to separate the presentation of
          a document from its structure. It provided web designers with more
          control over the appearance of web pages, allowing them to define
          styles and layouts. CSS1 was released in 1996, followed by CSS2 in
          1998. CSS3, the latest version, introduced many new features and
          enhancements, including transitions, animations, and responsive design
          capabilities.

          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>
            HTML offers a wide range of features that enable the creation of
            structured web content. Some of its key features include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements
              like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and
              &lt;article&gt;, which provide meaning and structure to the
              content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Forms: HTML includes form elements such as &lt;input&gt;,
              &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;textarea&gt;, allowing users to submit
              data to a web server.
            </li>
            <li>
              Multimedia: HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video
              elements, making it easier to embed multimedia content within web
              pages.
            </li>

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p>
            CSS, on the other hand, focuses on the visual aspects of web design.
            Here are some notable features of CSS:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selectors: CSS allows you to select specific elements on a web
              page and apply styles to them using selectors, such as class, ID,
              and element selectors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Layout: CSS provides various layout techniques, including floats,
              flexbox, and grid, which enable designers to create responsive and
              dynamic page layouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Animations and Transitions: CSS3 introduced powerful animation and
              transition properties, allowing designers to add movement and
              interactivity to their websites without relying on JavaScript.

          emerged in recent years. Here are a few notable trends:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Responsive Design: With the increasing popularity of mobile devices,

            creating websites that adapt to different screen sizes and
            resolutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Minimalism and Flat Design: Minimalistic designs with simple, clean

          </li>
          <li>
            CSS Frameworks: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have
            become popular among developers. These frameworks provide
            pre-designed components and styles, allowing for faster and more
            consistent web development.
